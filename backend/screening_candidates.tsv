I specialize in C#, .NET Core,\n\nASP.NET Core, and SQL Server and have led multiple Azure migration and modernization efforts\n\ninvolving AKS, App Services, Functions, and Cosmos DB. I architect microservices and containerized\n\nplatforms using Docker and Kubernetes (AKS), designing robust CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps\n\nand GitHub Actions and infrastructure as code with Terraform and ARM. I adopt AI-assisted\n\ndevelopment workflows daily—pairing with GitHub Copilot and Claude to accelerate design iterations,\n\nauto-generate tests, and refactor large code bases while maintaining production-grade quality and\n\ncompliance. I practice TDD and build automated testing frameworks (unit, integration, contract, and\n\nAPI tests) integrated into pipelines so code is delivery-ready at merge. I have deep experience with\n\nEntity Framework Core, optimizing LINQ and SQL Server performance, and introducing caching layers\n\n(Redis) to reduce database load. I lead cross-functional teams and mentor engineers on cloud best\n\npractices, microservices patterns, DDD/CQRS, and observability using Application Insights,\n\nPrometheus, and Grafana. I design defensive security patterns for payment and financial systems:\n\ndata encryption, Key Vault secrets management, OAuth/JWT, and PCI-aligned logging practices. I drive\n\ncost efficiency and reliability through right-sized Azure services, autoscaling AKS, and resilient\n\npatterns like retries, circuit breakers, and event-driven architectures using Azure Service Bus and\n\nKafka. I collaborate closely with product, QA, and platform teams to translate stakeholder\n\nconversations into structured specifications and implement AI-driven SDLC processes that improve\n\nthroughput and reduce defects. I have a strong ownership mindset, experience working with\n\ndistributed and offshore teams, and a track record of delivering high-uptime, high-throughput\n\nsystems for regulated environments.

enforced parameterized\n\nqueries to prevent SQL injection.\n\nBuilt reusable server-side components with dependency injection (Autofac) and unit-tested them\n\nusing MSTest to enable early, safe refactoring.\n\nCreated RESTful endpoints and documented them with Swagger/OpenAPI so third-party teams\n\ncould integrate programmatically with clear contracts.\n\nIntegrated message-based workflows using RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing of long-\n\nrunning jobs to decouple user requests from backend processing.\n\nAdministered CI pipelines with TeamCity and customized build scripts to run unit tests and\n\npackage artifacts for deployment.\n\nReduced application startup and response times by profiling with dotTrace, optimizing hot paths in\n\nC# and batching frequently used database calls.\n\nDesigned role-based UI components and server validation to comply with access rules and reduce\n\nfront-end complexity.\n\nAdopted coding standards and advocated for consistent branching strategies in Git, enabling\n\nmore predictable merges and release behavior.\n\nCollaborated with operations to automate releases to IIS and Azure App Services using PowerShell\n\nscripts and ARM templates for consistent environments.\n\nAuthored monitoring probes and alerts in Application Insights and Log Analytics to detect service\n\ndegradations early.\n\nTrained new hires on core platform frameworks, shared patterns, and troubleshooting approaches\n\nto accelerate onboarding.\n\nImplemented lightweight client-side modules with TypeScript and modular bundling with Webpack\n\nto improve maintainability and reduce front-end defects.\n\nPROJECTS\n\nAccount Reconciliation Microservice Platform 03/2019 – 08/2019\n\nDesigned and delivered a standalone reconciliation microservice platform to consolidate transaction\n\n\n\nstreams from multiple payment rails. Architecture used ASP.NET Core microservices, gRPC for low-latency\n\ninterservice calls, PostgreSQL for ledger storage and Redis for in-memory reconciliation caches. The\n\nplatform handled out-of-order message reconciliation by using idempotent event handlers and event\n\ndeduplication through a deterministic hashing strategy. I introduced an event-driven pipeline with Kafka to\n\ndecouple ingestion and reconciliation, enabling horizontal scaling for high-throughput bursts. Security was\n\nhandled via OAuth2 JWT tokens, data encryption at rest, and Key Vault for secrets. Observability\n\nincorporated OpenTelemetry, Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards to surface reconciliation lag\n\nand throughput trends.\n\nReduced reconciliation latency by 62% through in-memory caching and parallelized reconciliation\n\nworkers, enabling same-minute reconciliation for 75% of transactions.\n\nImplemented idempotent handlers and deduplication that removed double-processing and\n\nreduced downstream correction jobs by 85%.\n\nScaled ingestion pipeline to handle 20k events/sec by partitioning Kafka topics and autoscaling\n\nconsumer groups on Kubernetes; architecture supported 3x traffic spikes.\n\nBuilt end-to-end observability with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus; created SLA-focused\n\ndashboards that cut incident diagnosis time by 45%.\n\nInstituted secure secret management with Key Vault and rotated credentials without downtime\n\nusing Kubernetes secrets updates and rolling restarts.\n\nTechnologies: C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, gRPC, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus,\n\nGrafana, OpenTelemetry, OAuth2, Azure Key Vault\n\nPayment Gateway Adapter Layer 09/2018 – 12/2018\n\nDeveloped a modular payment gateway adapter layer to unify integration with multiple PSPs and banks. I\n\ndesigned the adapter using a plugin architecture in ASP.NET Core so new payment providers could be\n\nadded without application restarts. The system exposed secure RESTful APIs with OpenAPI definitions and\n\nused SQL Server for transaction persistence and Elasticsearch for transaction search and analytics. To\n\nhandle asynchronous provider callbacks I used Azure Service Bus and idempotency keys to protect against\n\nduplicate payments. I prioritized testability by generating contract tests for each provider adapter and\n\nrunning them in CI to validate integrations before deployment.\n\nReduced integration lead time for new PSPs from 6 weeks to 10 days by formalizing adapter\n\ncontracts and providing a reusable template.\n\nAchieved 99.98% transactional integrity by using idempotency keys and durable queue\n\nprocessing with Service Bus.\n\nEnabled near-real-time analytics by streaming transaction events to Elasticsearch and building\n\ndashboards for fraud and settlement teams.\n\nAutomated provider contract tests in CI to prevent regressions and catch schema drift prior to\n\nrollouts.\n\nImproved operational resilience by implementing retries, exponential backoff, and poison\n\nmessage handling for failed callbacks.\n\nTechnologies: C#, ASP.NET Core, Azure Service Bus, SQL Server, Elasticsearch, Azure DevOps, Docker,\n\nOpenAPI, xUnit, Postman\n\nDeveloper Productivity Toolkit with AI-Assisted Codegen 01/2020 – 06/2020\n\nBuilt an internal developer productivity toolkit that integrated AI-assisted code generation and test\n\nscaffolding to accelerate feature delivery. The toolkit consisted of a CLI and VS Code extension that used\n\nlocal templates, Roslyn analyzers and an integration with GitHub Copilot-style flows to propose method\n\nimplementations and unit tests. I designed the architecture to run locally and optionally call hosted AI\n\ncopilots, capturing suggestions as PR drafts so engineers could review and accept changes. The toolkit also\n\nproduced baseline unit and integration tests (xUnit) and created boilerplate CI job definitions to speed\n\n\n\npipeline setup. Focus was on developer ergonomics, reproducible builds, and safe adoption of code-assist\n\nworkflows.\n\nReduced initial feature scaffolding time by 70% by providing four standardized templates and\n\nauto-generated test scaffolds.\n\nIncreased PR acceptance rates for junior engineers by providing vetted, reviewable AI suggestions\n\ncaptured as draft commits.\n\nDecreased flaky tests by integrating deterministic test-data generators and containerized test\n\nharnesses for integration tests.\n\nProduced CI templates that reduced pipeline setup time from days to under an hour for new\n\nmicroservices.\n\nPromoted safe AI adoption by inserting review checkpoints and automated static analysis (Roslyn)\n\nbefore any AI-suggested code could be merged.\n\nTechnologies: C#, .NET Core, Roslyn, VS Code Extension API, GitHub Copilot, xUnit, Git, Azure DevOps, Node.js\n\n(CLI), Docker\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBachelor of Science in Computer Science 2015\n\nUniversity of Miami\n\nSKILLS\n\nLanguages:  C#, T-SQL, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PowerShell, Bash, Java, Go, HTML5, CSS3\n\nFrameworks:  .NET, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Dapper, gRPC, SignalR, React,\n\nNode.js, Express, Spring Boot, MassTransit, Flask, Django, xUnit\n\nDatabases:  Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB,\n\nRedis, Elasticsearch\n\nTools:  Azure, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure App Service, Azure Functions, Azure DevOps,\n\nGitHub Actions, Git, GitHub, GitLab, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, ARM templates, Prometheus,\n\nGrafana, Application Insights, OpenTelemetry, SonarQube, Serilog, ELK (Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana),\n\nNUnit, xUnit, MSTest, Postman, Swagger / OpenAPI, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Key Vault, OAuth2\n\n/ JWT, Polly, dotTrace, dotMemory, Visual Studio, VS Code, Webpack, Azure Monitor, New Relic, Sentry,\n\nSelenium, Fiddler, Coverlet, JIRA, Confluence, Datadog, Cloudflare, Consul, Flux, ArgoCD, Claude\n\n(Anthropic), GitHub Copilot, MLflow, TensorFlow (exposure), Kibana, Cosmos DB Emulator, Azure Blob\n\nStorage, Power BI, SSIS
